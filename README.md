# Use Claude Code to Explore and Develop the project 
### Download the zip file of branch 'initial'
https://github.com/uopsdod/claude_code_treasure_game/tree/initial

### initialize the context
/clear
/init: generate the CLAUDE.md to understand how this project works 

npm install
npm run dev'

### specify file to the current context 
> use @src/audios/chest_open.mp3 in the @src/App.tsx to play the sound effect of the chest being opened. do not do anything else.

### add more to the context
> check the comments of existing changes

type '#' first 
"Always add comments on the top of every new function in one line to summarize the usage and Must document the inputs and output parameters" 

> 2. Project memory

> use @src/audios/chest_open_with_evil_laugh.mp3 in the @src/App.tsx to play the sound effect of the chest with skeleton inside being opened  

> check the comments of existing changes

### use screenshot to develop intuitively 
> screenshot and mark the area you want the change to be. 
> [!image] show the results to be either: win, tie, loss in the circled place according to the final score 

### Challenge: change the hover mouse point icon
use the src/assets/key.png icon when the mouse hovers over the closed treasure box

### manage context 
/context 
54k/200k tokens (27%)

> (optional) go through the url recursively to understand everything about SQLite and add all information in the context. 
https://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/sqlite.html                                                      

/compact

/context

> "Check my project with AngularJS to see if any syntax error."

esc + esc > select a conversation to go back 

### Plan mode: 
make a commit to store the current state

shift + tab 
> "What database options I have to implement sign up and sign in flow?"
> "how about SQLite as local storage?"
> "use SQLite to build a simple sign up and sign in flow and store the game score for each signed in user. In addition, allow to play the game as guest mode without storing any data."

> Ctrl + T: See the To-Do List 

### Ultrathink 
revert back to previous git commit 

> "Ultrathink to use SQLite to build a simple sign up and sign in flow and store the game score for each signed in user. In addition, allow to play the game as guest mode without storing any data."

### custom command - check_typo 
"Slash commands in Claude Code are custom prompts stored as Markdown files that you can trigger with a simple /command-name syntax. Think of them as reusable prompt templates that encapsulate specific workflows or instructions."

create folder: .claude/commands
create file: check_typo.md

> I'm creating a new check_typo command @.claude/commands/check_typo.md . help me fill in information for checking Engligh grammar, typo, acronyms  

re-open a new claude code session

modify the /App.tsx with some typos, probably modify the comments  

> /check_typo @src/App.tsx

> "fix those typos for me"

### custom command - deploy to Github Pages 
sign in to Github 
create a new public project "claude_code_treasure_game"

brew install gh
gh auth login

===
echo "# claude_code_treasure_game_001" >> README.md
git init
git add README.md
git commit -m "first commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/uopspop/claude_code_treasure_game_001.git
git push -u origin main
===

create folder: .claude/commands
create file: deploy_to_github_page.md

> I'm creating a new check_typo command @.claude/commands/deploy_to_github_page.md . help me finish it to deploy my project to Github Pages. Include an Argument to specify which branch to use for Github Page deployment. 

re-open claude code 

/deploy_to_github_page gh_page_demo_002

Go to Github > Go to Repo > Settings > Page > Select branch: "gh_page_demo_002"
